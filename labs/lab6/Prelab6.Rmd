__(a.)__
Fit a multiple regression model to predict Sales using Price,
Urban, and US.
```{r}
library(ISLR)
data(Carseats)
model1<-lm(Sales~Price+Urban+US, data=Carseats)
summary(model1)
```

__(b.)__
Provide an interpretation of each coefficient in the model. Be
carefulâ€”some of the variables in the model are qualitative!

\begin{itemize}
\item{Price:} (-0.054459) unit of increase in Price would cause a 54.459 decrease in Sales, the variable Price is statistically significant.
\item {UrbanYes:} (-0.021916): Sales are 22 lower for Urban locations, the variable Urban is not statistically significant.
\item {USYes:} (1.200573): Sales are 1200.573 higher in the US locations, the variable US is statistically significant.
\end{itemize}
